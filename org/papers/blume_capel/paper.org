* Introduction

** The Blume-Capel model

The Blume-Capel model was first proposed in the 60's in the context of

The dynamics of the short-range spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model is described by the following Hamiltonian:

\[ H = - J \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} s_i s_j + D \sum_i s_i^2 \]

where $\langle i, j \rangle$ indicates that the summation is over the nearest neighbor pair of sites $i$ and $j$.

Despite its simplicity and resemblance to the classic short-range Ising model, the short-range Blume-Capel possess a much richer phase diagram comprised of a second order line

A feature of the Blume-Capel model


** Method

The use of random matrices for the investigation of critical phenomena in spin systems has been previously explored



* Results

** Second order:

*** Isotropic model
