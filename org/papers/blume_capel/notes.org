* Ideas

+ Generate artificial time series matrices with columns all $-1$ or $+1$ shuffle columns and calculate correlation matrix.
  + The expected entries in the correlation matrix are $-1$ and $+1$.
  + How is it different from generating a symmetric matrix from $-1$ and $+1$ entries
    + Does shuffle make a difference?
+ Blume-Capel system initial state sampled only from spins $\{-1, +1\}$ and not $0$.
  + Can the system reach equilibrium faster.
+ Measurement of the correlation between eigenvalues from the same matrix
  + How are two arbitrary eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_j$ correlated?
  + How are $\lambda_{min}$ and $\lambda_{max}$ correlated?
