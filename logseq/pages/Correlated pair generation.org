* Assume $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ to be independent and identically distributed random variables.
For an arbitrary correlation $\rho \in [-1,1]$:
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin^{-1} \rho$$
Therefore the variables:
\begin{cases}
\phi_1 = \sin(\theta) \varphi_1 + \cos(\theta) \varphi_2 \\
\phi_2 = \cos(\theta) \varphi_1 + \sin(\theta) \varphi_2 \\
\end{cases}
are distributed according to the same original distribution and their correlation is $\rho$.
