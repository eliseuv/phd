#+title: Brass cellular automaton magnetization time series normalized correlation matrix eigenvalues distributions
#+author:

* The Brass cellular automaton model

The Brass cellular automaton originally proposed by [cite:@brassDynamicalCriticalBehavior1994; @brassCellularAutomataModel1994] and further analyzed in attempts to model the =T-helper= cells

The model used is the probabilistic Cellular Automaton proposed by [cite:@tomeProbabilisticCellularAutomaton1996]


* Determination coefficient

* Cross correlation matrix




** Eigenvalues distributions
